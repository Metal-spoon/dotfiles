Hello, this is my personal dotfiles repo.

The main branch will probably not contain much other than this readme.

This repo is intended to be cloned with the --bare flag.

Dotfiles for my various setups will be in their own branch, i might include previews below.

# i3-laptop
This is my i3 setup for my laptop.

It currently has the following dependencies:
* i3-gaps
* picom
* polybar

fonts used:
* Hasklug nerd font
* Material design icons
